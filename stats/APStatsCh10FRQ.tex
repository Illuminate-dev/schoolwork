\subsection*{a)}

\textbf{STATE:} 99\% confidence interval for $p_1-p_2$, where $p_1$ is the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed men assigned to the surgery that survived 
for 5 years and $p_2$ is the proportion of prostate-cancer diagnosed men treated with observation only that survived for 5 years.

\noindent\textbf{PLAN:} two-sample z test for $p_1 - p_2$

    \textbf{Random:} participants were randomly assigned

    \textbf{10\%:} likely 367 is more than 10\% of all prostate-cancer patients and thus same with 364.

    \textbf{Large Counts:} $\hat{p}_1n_1 = 245 \ge 10$, $(1-\hat{p}_1)n_1 = 122 \ge 10$, $\hat{p}_2n_2 = 223 \ge 10$ and $(1-\hat{p}_2)n_2 = 141 \ge 10$

\noindent\textbf{DO:}
\begin{align*}
  \hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 &\pm z^* \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}} \\
  & \text{where } \hat{p}_1 = 0.668 \text{ and } \hat{p}_2 = 0.613 \text{ and} \\
  & n_1 = 367 \text{ and } n_2 = 364 \text{ and} \\
  & t^* = -\text{invNorm}(area:0.005) \approx 2.576 \\
  0.055 &\pm 0.091 \\
\end{align*}

\noindent\textbf{CONCLUDE:} Thus, we are 99\% confident that the true difference in proportions
of prostate cancer diagnosed men who are treated with surgery and with observation is between -0.036 and 0.146.

\subsection*{b)}
% Does the confidence interval provide convincing evidence that the true proportions differ? Justify your answer.

No, the confidence interval does not provide convincing evidence that the true proportions differ because the interval contains 0.

\subsection*{a)}
% Construct and interpret a 99% confidence interval for the difference in mean amount of food Piper eats
% when she is offered Pick-a-Pair and when she is offered Pickled Peppers.

\textbf{STATE:} 99\% confidence interval for $\mu_1 - \mu_2$, where $\mu_1$ is the mean amount of food Piper eats when she is offered Pick-a-Pair and $\mu_2$ is the mean amount of food Piper eats when she is offered Pickled Peppers.

\noindent\textbf{PLAN:} two-sample t test for $\mu_1 - \mu_2$

  \textbf{Random:} each trial is randomly assigned

  \textbf{10\%:} 31 is likely less than 10\% of all times Piper ate, and same with 30.

  \textbf{Large Counts:} $n_1 = 31 \ge 30$ and $n_2 = 30 \ge 30$

\noindent\textbf{DO:}
\begin{align*}
  \bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2 &\pm t^* \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1}+\frac{s_2^2}{n_2}} \\ 
  & \text{where } \bar{x}_1 = 85.2 \text { and } \bar{x}_2 = 82.1 \text{ and} \\
  & s_1 = 3.45 \text{ and } s_2 = 4.62 \text{ and} \\
  & n_1 = 31 \text{ and } n_2 = 30 \text{ and} \\
  & t^* = -\text{invT}(area:0.005, df: 29) \approx 2.76 \\
  3.1 &\pm 2.89
\end{align*}

\noindent\textbf{CONCLUDE:} Thus, we are 99\% confident that the true difference in means of the amount of food Piper eats when she is offered Pick-a-Pair and when she is offered Pickled Peppers is between 0.21 and 5.99.

\subsection*{b)}
% Suppose we want to test the hypothesis that the mean amount of Pick-a-Pair that Pickles eats is higher 
% than the mean amount of Pickled Peppers she eats. State the null and alternative hypotheses for this test.

\textbf{Null Hypothesis:} $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$ (the mean amount of food Piper eats when she is offered Pick-a-Pair is equal to the mean amount of food Piper eats when she is offered Pickled Peppers)

\noindent\textbf{Alternative Hypothesis:} $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 > 0$ (the mean amount of food Piper eats when she is offered Pick-a-Pair is greater than the mean amount of food Piper eats when she is offered Pickled Peppers)

\subsection*{c)}
% The standardized test statistic is t = 2.96 and the P-value is 0.002. Draw an appropriate conclusion using
% Î± = 0.01.
Since the P-value (0.002) is less than the significance level (0.01), we reject the null hypothesis and
conclude that there is convincing evidence that the mean amount of food Piper eats when she is offered 
Pick-a-Pair is greater than the mean amount of food Piper eats when she is offered Pickled Peppers)
